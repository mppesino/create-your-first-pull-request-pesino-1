My Expectations for CMSC 100 

I expect to learn a lot in CMSC 100, and to utilize Git to its fullest potential.

Specifically, I expect to learn:
	- How to make websites and webpages
	- How to integrate this with a web server so others can see
    - How to collaborate with others via Git and GitHub
    - How to work in a team by having offline workflows with Git
